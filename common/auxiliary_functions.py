Auxiliary function that will open a UDP socket that receives LoRaWAN messages coming from a LoRa
gateway, using port 5200 to receive those messages. When the UDP socket receives those messages, it
will forward them to a Kafka producer that will have a topic called lorawan-messages, where the UDP socket
will send the received LoRaWAN messages. Those messages will, then, be available on the Kafka producer
on that topic, on port 9092, to be consumed by Spark, which will group the messages using batches
and process them
